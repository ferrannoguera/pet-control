# PetControl

Android app created for Interaction and Interface Design course from Bachelor in informatics engineering in FIB - UPC.

This has been my first android app ever.

It is an app that allows to to keep information from your pets. Some of the functionalities are:
- Registering your pet/s.
- Add their photos.
- Create calenders in order to know when to fed them and different other information you should consider.
